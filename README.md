I'm sharing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  of the data from Spotify using SQL

# Project Description

Spotify is a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider founded in April 2006. It is the world's largest music streaming service provider and has over 381 million monthly active users, which also includes 172 million paid subscribers.

Here, l have explored and quantified data about music and drawn valuable insights. Conducted data cleaning to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Spotify dataset using SQL - Exploring the relationship between the audio features of a song and how positive or negative its lyrics are and many more. Spotify Data Analysis makes use of secondary data from Spotify. Use data to identify patterns and relationships between different characteristics. The activity will support in developing ability to review and interpret a dataset.

# Technologies used
Python, SQL, MS-Excel

# Dataset

# Project Objective:
The objective of this SQL project is to perform an in-depth analysis of the Spotify song dataset, focusing on various aspects, including song duration, artist information, valence, tempo, and mood. The project aims to extract meaningful insights and answer questions related to song characteristics, artist popularity, and emotional content within the songs.

# Project Conclusion:
Through this project, we have successfully conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Spotify song dataset. Here are some key findings and conclusions:

Artist Analysis: We determined which artists had the most songs in the Top 100 list and identified the songs with the highest and lowest keys for each artist. Additionally, we compared the presence of artists with 'Lil' in their name to those with 'DJ' in their name.

Song Analysis: We found the longest and shortest songs in terms of duration and identified the top 5 longest and shortest songs in minutes. We also determined which songs featured additional artists.

Duration Analysis: We calculated the average song duration with and without featured artists, providing insights into song length based on the presence of additional contributors.

Song Mood Analysis: We classified songs into mood categories (euphoric, euthymic, or sad) based on their valence scores, providing a deeper understanding of the emotional content in the dataset.

Tempo and Danceability Analysis: We categorized songs into different tempo groups and examined their danceability, which helps us understand the relationship between tempo and danceability.

Liveliness and Mellowness Analysis: We explored songs based on liveliness (danceability, energy, and valence) and mellowness (danceability, energy, and valence), providing insights into the musical characteristics associated with these moods.

Overall, this project offers a comprehensive analysis of the Spotify song dataset, providing valuable insights into song and artist characteristics, as well as emotional and musical aspects. These findings can be useful for music enthusiasts, researchers, and anyone interested in understanding trends in popular music. The project demonstrates the power of SQL in extracting and analyzing data to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.
